# bus-mall
* Since catalogs are expensive to print and distribute, and the products cost money to make and warehouse, and BusMall is a lean startup that needs to carefully watch its expenditures, BusMall wants to feature only the items in its catalog that are the most likely to sell
* The appâ€™s purpose is to have the group members choose which product, of the three displayed images, that they would be most likely to purchase, and then store, calculate, and visually display the resulting data
* To keep the product selection process as untainted as possible, i didnt allow any results to be shown to users until there have been a total of 25 selections made.

* i wrote this code to to show 3 pictures for 25 times and after that i calculate how many times the users show every image and how many time the user click in any image 
after that i store how many times the user show every image and how many time click in any image .
we store it in the local storage .
